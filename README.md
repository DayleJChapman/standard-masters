# Standard Masters

Standard Masters is a Magic: The Gathering battle box set. It is composed of some of the most powerful and iconic standard decks to ever see the Pro Tour. In this repository, you will find all the resources for the set, including decks lists, primers and the story behind each of these powerhouse decks.

While all decks can be played against one another, each deck has been assigned a power rating to help you pick balanced mathcups. Each decklist is based off a specific list from an event of it's era, but may include additional sideboard cards from the standard format to help give it some options against the other decks in _this_ format.

## Tournament Format

While these decks can be played in pickup games against one another, they are also great for a mini 'tournament'. This game mode is meant for 8 players, but can be played with as few as 4.

To start, randomly assign each player a number between 1 and 8. Decks are selected in snake order (ie. 1 to 8, then 8 to 1), suhc that each player has 2 decks. Once complete, players will be paired against their opposite number (1 vs 8, 7 vs 2 etc).

When starting a match, start by determining play order as normal. The player who goes first must then select one of their two decks, followed by the player going second. When a player wins with a deck, they can no longer use that deck for the rest of the match. Players must get a game win with **both** decks to recieve a match win. There is no sideboarding between games in this format.

Matches are then played out as a regular tournament bracket.

## History

During the _Scars of Mirrodin_ and _Zendikar_ Standard format (2010–2011), _Caw-Blade_ became one of the most dominant and oppressive decks in Magic’s history. The deck revolved around the synergy between cheap, evasive creatures—primarily _Squadron Hawk_—and powerful _Sword of Feast and Famine_, which allowed for devastating tempo swings. With _Jace, the Mind Sculptor_ providing card selection and _Stoneforge Mystic_ tutoring up equipment, Caw-Blade could seamlessly transition between control and aggression. The combination of resilient threats, efficient removal, and repeated untap effects from _Sword of Feast and Famine_ led to overwhelming board states that opponents struggled to break through. By mid-2011, the deck had completely warped Standard, leading to widespread frustration among players.

Despite attempts to adapt, most other decks couldn’t compete, forcing Wizards of the Coast to take action. In June 2011, both _Jace, the Mind Sculptor_ and _Stoneforge Mystic_ were banned from Standard—a rare move at the time—effectively ending the deck’s reign. However, the influence of Caw-Blade persisted, as later control decks continued to adopt elements of its strategy, including tempo-based threats and strong card selection. The deck’s dominance also changed the way Wizards designed future formats, making them more cautious about the power level of card selection and equipment-based strategies. Even years later, Caw-Blade remains one of the most infamous Standard decks ever, remembered both for its oppressive gameplay and for reshaping Magic’s approach to balancing powerful control decks.

## Startegy

The deck focuses on control through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card advantage provided by Jace planeswalkers. The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up powerful equipment like Batterskull and Swords to close out the game. Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic help with card advantage and fetching key pieces, while Celestial Colonnade provides a versatile threat. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management and efficient use of its versatile removal and counter suite.

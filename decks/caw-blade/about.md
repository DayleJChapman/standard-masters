## About

If there is any deck that embodies the concept of tempo control, it's Caw-Blade. Named after it's unique card advantage and threat engine of Squadron Hawk plus Stoneforge Mystic, this deck went down in history as one of the most infamous standard decks of the modern era of Magic. Resulting in the first standard bannings in over 5 years, with both Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Stoneforge Mystic getting the axe.

## Startegy 

Caw-Blade plays like just like your typical tempo deck. Stick a threat like a Squadron Hawk holding a Sword, and protect it using your countermagic. Jace, the Mind Sculptor is your late game haymaker. Once in play, Jace can provide one of the most powerful card advantage engines standard has ever seen with it's 0 ability. Have a bunch of extra hawks in your hand? Brainstorm them to the top of the deck then shuffle them away with a Stoneforge or send them right to the bottom with Preordain.

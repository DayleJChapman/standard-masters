## History

During the _Theros_ Standard format (2013–2014), Mono-Black Devotion became the defining deck of the era, built around the powerful devotion mechanic and a suite of efficient disruption, removal, and resilient threats. The deck's core revolved around _Thoughtseize_ and _Hero’s Downfall_ for control, _Underworld Connections_ for card advantage, and _Pack Rat_—a seemingly innocuous two-drop that could quickly snowball into an unstoppable threat. However, the deck’s true finisher was _Gray Merchant of Asphodel_, affectionately nicknamed “Gary” by players. With its devotion-based life drain effect, _Gary_ could swing games instantly, often draining opponents for massive amounts of life once the battlefield was stacked with black pips from _Nightveil Specter_, _Desecration Demon_, and _Underworld Connections_.

Despite initial skepticism about its slow, grindy nature, Mono-Black Devotion quickly proved its dominance, defining the format alongside its biggest rival, Mono-Blue Devotion. The deck's ability to dismantle opponents with discard and removal while building toward game-ending _Gary_ drains made it a nightmare to face. Even after bans to cards like _Pack Rat_ and _Thoughtseize_ in later formats, the deck’s legacy endured as one of the strongest mono-colored archetypes in Magic’s history. Mono-Black Devotion not only shaped competitive play but also demonstrated the sheer power of devotion as a mechanic, cementing _Gary_ as one of the most beloved finishers in Standard history.

## Startegy

The focus of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive black creatures and generate a high devotion to black for powerful effects. The main strategy involves playing efficient threats like Pack Rat, Desecration Demon, and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, while disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Thoughtseize and controlling the board with removal spells like Bile Blight and Hero's Downfall. The deck also utilizes card draw and mana ramp from cards like Underworld Connections and Mutavault to maintain a consistent advantage and pressure the opponent.

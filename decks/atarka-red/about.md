## History

During the _Khans of Tarkir_ and _Battle for Zendikar_ Standard (2015–2016), Atarka Red emerged as one of the most explosive aggro decks of the format. Built around cheap, aggressive creatures and backed by powerful burn spells, the deck aimed to end games as quickly as possible. Its signature card was _Atarka’s Command_, a versatile instant that could pump the team, deal direct damage, and even accelerate mana in certain situations. The deck’s core featured efficient threats like _Monastery Swiftspear_, _Zurgo Bellstriker_, and _Abbot of Keral Keep_, alongside burn spells such as _Wild Slash_ and _Stoke the Flames_. What made Atarka Red truly terrifying, however, was its ability to win out of nowhere—thanks to _Temur Battle Rage_ and _Become Immense_, a single unblocked creature could suddenly deal lethal damage with a massive double-strike attack.

Atarka Red’s blistering speed made it one of the premier decks in Standard, forcing slower decks to adjust or risk being overrun. Control decks struggled to stabilize in time, while midrange strategies often fell behind due to the deck’s relentless pressure. Even after the rotation of key cards, variations of Atarka Red continued to see success, adapting with new threats and burn options. Its legacy remains as one of the most efficient and explosive aggro decks of its era, cementing _Atarka’s Command_ as a staple of aggressive red-green strategies for years to come.

## Startegy

The main focus of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of cheap and aggressive creatures such as Monastery Swiftspear, Zurgo Bellstriker, and Abbot of Keral Keep. The deck also includes various pump spells like Titan's Strength and Become Immense to deal massive damage in a single turn. By utilizing cards like Dragon Fodder and Hordeling Outburst to create a wide board presence, the deck aims to finish the game swiftly with powerful combat tricks like Temur Battle Rage and Atarka's Command.

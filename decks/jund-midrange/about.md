## History

During the _Innistrad_ and _Return to Ravnica_ Standard format (2012–2013), _Jund Midrange_ rose to prominence as one of the most dominant and well-rounded decks in the metagame. Rooted in the traditional strengths of Jund—efficient removal, resilient threats, and powerful card advantage—the deck excelled at grinding out wins through sheer value. Its core threats included _Huntmaster of the Fells_, which provided both life gain and board presence, and _Olivia Voldaren_, a nightmare for creature-based decks that could take over games if left unchecked. Complementing these creatures were powerful spells like _Farseek_, enabling a smooth three-color mana base, and _Rakdos’s Return_, which could strip an opponent’s hand while delivering a massive burn spell.

What truly made _Jund Midrange_ so powerful was its ability to shift roles seamlessly. Against aggressive decks, it could stabilize with _Huntmaster of the Fells_ and efficient removal like _Pillar of Flame_ and _Abrupt Decay_. Against control, _Rakdos’s Return_ and _Garruk, Primal Hunter_ provided overwhelming card advantage. The deck also had one of the best finishers in Standard—_Thragtusk_, whose enter-the-battlefield effect and resilience against removal made it a nightmare for opponents. Backed by an incredibly consistent mana base powered by _Shocklands_ and _Checklands_, _Jund Midrange_ remained a dominant force throughout its Standard tenure. Even as the format evolved, its sheer efficiency and adaptability ensured that Jund remained a top-tier choice until rotation, solidifying its legacy as one of the strongest midrange decks of its era.

_Creator's Note:_ This deck holds a particularly special place in my heart. Having reached the height of it's career at the same time I started playng the game, this was the deck that made me fall in love with the competitive aspect of this game. The countless hours of watching Reid Duke and William Jensen pilot the deck on SCG coverage would shape my favored playstyle to this day.

## Startegy

This deck thrives on methodically dismantling the opponent’s strategy while relentlessly pulling ahead in value. With a near-perfect blend of removal, hand disruption, and game-breaking threats, _Jund Midrange_ controls the pace of play from the very first turn. _Rakdos’s Return_ and _Bonfire of the Damned_ serve as devastating swing spells, crippling opposing hands or wiping out entire boards in one fell swoop. Meanwhile, resilient creatures like _Thragtusk_ and _Olivia Voldaren_ ensure that once Jund stabilizes, it quickly turns the corner into an overwhelming offensive. Planeswalkers like _Garruk, Primal Hunter_ provide an endless stream of threats or card draw, making it nearly impossible for an opponent to recover. By expertly balancing removal, disruption, and late-game inevitability, this deck doesn’t just win—it grinds opponents into submission, leaving them with no options but to watch as Jund takes complete control of the game.

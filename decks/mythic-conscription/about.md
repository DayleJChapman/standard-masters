## History

During the Zendikar–Rise of the Eldrazi Standard format (2010), Mythic Conscription emerged as a brutally explosive deck that combined mana acceleration, powerful creatures, and one of the scariest finishers of the era—Eldrazi Conscription. At its core, the deck was an evolution of Bant Mythic, a deck that already leveraged fast mana and high-value threats, but Mythic Conscription took it a step further by introducing a near-instant kill combo. With mana dorks like Noble Hierarch and Lotus Cobra, the deck could curve out into early planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura, or drop a massive Baneslayer Angel. But its deadliest play came from Sovereigns of Lost Alara, which allowed a player to cheat Eldrazi Conscription into play for free, turning even a humble Birds of Paradise into a trampling 11/12 annihilator nightmare.

The deck had the speed to outpace control and the power to crush aggro decks that couldn’t interact fast enough. By ramping into threats early and forcing opponents into reactive positions, Mythic Conscription dictated the flow of the game. Control decks struggled against its relentless aggression, and midrange decks had a hard time matching its sheer efficiency. The deck’s ability to drop game-ending threats in the first few turns made it one of the most feared archetypes of its time. Though Eldrazi Conscription was a seemingly clunky, eight-mana aura, Mythic Conscription proved that the right shell could turn it into an instant win button.

## Startegy

This deck is all about sheer, unrelenting pressure—deploying massive threats ahead of schedule and forcing opponents into impossible positions. Thanks to Noble Hierarch and Lotus Cobra, Mythic Conscription explodes onto the battlefield, enabling turn-three Baneslayer Angel or an early Gideon Jura to completely take over the game. But the real knockout punch comes from Sovereigns of Lost Alara, which can instantly turn any creature—no matter how small—into a monstrous, trampling, annihilating titan by cheating out Eldrazi Conscription. Planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor add both control and card selection, ensuring the deck never runs out of gas. The well-tuned mana base guarantees that the deck can seamlessly transition between aggression and control, adapting to whatever the opponent throws at it. With its blistering speed and inevitability, Mythic Conscription doesn’t just win games—it bulldozes through them.

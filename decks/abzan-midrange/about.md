## History

During the _Theros_ and _Khans of Tarkir_ Standard format (2014–2015), Abzan Midrange emerged as one of the most dominant archetypes, built around resilient threats, efficient removal, and value-driven creatures. Initially, players were skeptical of _Siege Rhino_, a four-mana 4/5 with trample that drained opponents for three life upon entering the battlefield. With _Polukranos, World Eater_ from _Theros_ still legal—a similarly statted but mana-sink threat—many dismissed _Siege Rhino_ as too slow or lacking impact. However, once _Khans of Tarkir_ was released, it became clear that _Siege Rhino_’s immediate life swing, alongside powerful cards like _Thoughtseize_, _Courser of Kruphix_, and _Abzan Charm_, made the deck a powerhouse in attrition battles.

The sheer strength of _Siege Rhino_ and the Abzan color combination led to multiple variants of the deck beyond just midrange. Abzan Aggro, utilizing _Fleecemane Lion_, _Rakshasa Deathdealer_, and _Anafenza, the Foremost_, pushed a more tempo-driven approach, while Abzan Control leaned into _Elspeth, Sun’s Champion_, _Utter End_, and _End Hostilities_ to dominate the late game. Despite the presence of Jeskai and Temur decks, Abzan Midrange cemented itself as a format-defining force, with _Siege Rhino_ at its core. Its ability to stabilize the board, pressure opponents, and provide immediate impact ensured its place as one of the most feared cards of its era.

## Startegy

The key concept of this deck is to quickly establish a board presence with efficient creatures like Sylvan Caryatid, Courser of Kruphix, and Siege Rhino. These creatures provide early defense and generate card advantage through their abilities. The deck also includes a suite of removal spells like Thoughtseize, Hero's Downfall, and Utter End to handle threats from the opponent. The deck's planeswalkers, namely Sorin, Solemn Visitor, Ajani, Mentor of Heroes, and Elspeth, Sun's Champion, provide additional value and can help close out the game.

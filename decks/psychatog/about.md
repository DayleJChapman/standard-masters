## History

During the Odyssey–Onslaught Standard format (2002–2003), UB Psychatog was the premier control deck, defining competitive Magic with its blend of disruption, card draw, and a terrifyingly efficient win condition. Psychatog itself was an unassuming three-mana creature that quickly became one of the most feared finishers of its time. By exiling cards from the graveyard and discarding from hand, Psychatog could suddenly grow into a lethal attacker, often killing in a single swing. The deck's true power, however, came from its ability to control every aspect of the game until it was ready to win. With an arsenal of counterspells like Counterspell and Mana Leak, as well as card draw from Fact or Fiction and Deep Analysis, UB Psychatog ensured that opponents were always playing from behind.

The deck’s most infamous play pattern revolved around Upheaval, a six-mana sorcery that bounced all permanents back to their owners' hands. By floating mana beforehand, a UB Psychatog player could immediately replay Psychatog after resetting the board, leaving opponents with nothing while setting up a lethal attack. This combination of control, card advantage, and an instant-speed win condition made UB Psychatog the dominant deck of its era, crushing slower strategies while outmaneuvering aggressive decks with efficient removal like Smother and Chainer’s Edict. Even after its time in Standard, Psychatog remained a force in Extended and even Vintage, solidifying its place as one of the most iconic control decks in Magic history.

Even decades later, Psychatog’s legacy lives on, especially with the recent printing of its spiritual successor, Psychic Frog. The new iteration refines Psychatog's abilities while introducing even more broken interactions, leading to an immediate ban in Legacy due to its oppressive synergy with cheap cantrips and graveyard recursion. In Modern, Psychic Frog remains a dominant force, warping the format around its ability to turn an innocuous control shell into a lightning-fast kill. Just as Psychatog once shaped an entire Standard format, Psychic Frog continues to prove that the ability to turn excess resources into a game-ending threat is just as terrifying now as it was in 2002.

## Startegy

UB Psychatog is a masterclass in inevitability, leveraging airtight control, relentless card advantage, and an explosive, near-unstoppable win condition. The deck thrives on dictating the pace of the game, using counterspells like Counterspell and Circular Logic to shut down threats while drawing deeper into its library with Fact or Fiction and Deep Analysis. Every card discarded or milled fuels Psychatog, turning the graveyard into a lethal weapon. The real backbreaker, though, is Upheaval—a devastating board reset that, when timed correctly, allows Psychatog to hit the battlefield unopposed, often sealing the game in one attack. By expertly balancing interaction, card selection, and patience, UB Psychatog ensures that opponents slowly lose their grip on the game before being completely overwhelmed by the deck’s sheer inevitability.

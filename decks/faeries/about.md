## History

During the _Lorwyn_ and _Shadowmoor_ Standard format (2008–2009), UB Faeries dominated competitive play as one of the most frustratingly efficient tempo decks in Magic history. Built around _Bitterblossom_, an absurdly powerful two-mana enchantment that produced an endless stream of _Faerie Rogue_ tokens, the deck combined cheap, evasive threats with relentless disruption. _Spellstutter Sprite_ functioned as both a counterspell and a creature, while _Mistbind Clique_ could effectively _Time Walk_ an opponent by tapping down their lands during upkeep. Cards like _Cryptic Command_ and _Scion of Oona_ further enhanced the deck’s ability to control the game while pressuring opponents with an ever-growing army of flying creatures. The synergy between these pieces made UB Faeries nearly unbeatable in the hands of skilled players, leading to widespread frustration and its reputation as one of the most oppressive Standard decks ever.

UB Faeries excelled at playing on the opponent’s turn, flashing in creatures while keeping mana up for counterspells and removal. The deck preyed on slower strategies, punishing opponents who stumbled even slightly. Control decks struggled against its disruptive elements, while aggro decks found themselves overwhelmed by _Bitterblossom_'s constant stream of blockers. Even after _Bitterblossom_ rotated out of Standard, Faeries continued to be a force in Extended and Modern, with many of its core pieces remaining powerful in eternal formats. Its dominance forced Wizards of the Coast to rethink how they designed small, efficient flyers and tribal synergies in future sets. To this day, UB Faeries remains one of the most iconic tempo decks in Magic history, setting the standard for reactive, flash-heavy strategies in competitive play.

## History

The Nexus of Fate + Wilderness Reclamation Standard deck is as notable for its gameplay as it is for the oddities surrounding the printing of _Nexus of Fate_ itself. Originally designed as a promotional card for _Magic: The Gathering_ events, _Nexus of Fate_ was printed exclusively for the _2019 Mythic Championship_ and was not part of regular booster packs. This made the card rare, difficult to acquire, and a bit of an oddity in Standard play. The combination of its potent ability to take extra turns and its limited availability led to a peculiar situation where players scrambled to obtain copies of the card, despite the fact that it was meant to be a one-off promotional item.

The card’s strange distribution wasn’t the only issue—_Nexus of Fate_ was also plagued by foiling problems that made it nearly impossible to play in competitive events. The card’s foil printing was so prone to severe warping that judges often had to issue proxies for the card at official tournaments, leading to frustration from the player base. Despite all this, _Nexus of Fate_ quickly became a key piece of the archetype, but its overwhelming power and the uncomfortable logistics around its play eventually led to its ban in Standard in 2020. The entire situation was a rare case of a card’s overpowered nature, paired with its bizarre printing and availability issues, making _Nexus of Fate_ a memorable part of Magic’s history.

## Startegy

The main idea of this deck is to utilize Wilderness Reclamation to generate extra mana during your turn and then chain together extra turns using Nexus of Fate. By using cards like Tamiyo, Collector of Tales and Search for Azcanta to dig for combo pieces, the deck aims to create a loop of extra turns and card advantage to overwhelm your opponent. The inclusion of Root Snare and Callous Dismissal helps to stall the game and protect your game plan until you can achieve victory through the combo.

## History

During the _Kaladesh_ and _Aether Revolt_ Standard format (2016–2017), the _Saheeli Rai_ and _Felidar Guardian_ combo—known as "Copy Cat"—became one of the most infamous two-card combos in Magic history. The deck exploited _Saheeli Rai_'s -2 ability to create a token copy of _Felidar Guardian_, whose enter-the-battlefield effect could then blink _Saheeli Rai_, resetting her loyalty and allowing the loop to continue infinitely. With enough iterations, the deck could generate an army of hasty _Felidar Guardian_ tokens and win the game immediately. Shockingly, Wizards of the Coast admitted that the interaction was an oversight—they hadn't realized the infinite combo existed when they designed the cards. This mistake led to an immediate metagame shake-up, as the format quickly became centered around either playing _Copy Cat_ or finding ways to stop it.

The deck thrived in multiple shells, often as a Jeskai or Four-Color Control build that could play a fair game with _Torrential Gearhulk_, _Harnessed Lightning_, and _Negate_ while always threatening an instant-win combo. Its oppressive nature led to widespread frustration, culminating in Wizards banning _Felidar Guardian_ just months after its release. However, the energy-based shells that supported _Copy Cat_ didn’t disappear—they evolved into the _Aetherworks Marvel_ deck, which abused _Aetherworks Marvel_ to cheat out massive threats like _Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger_. This strategy became so dominant that multiple cards, including _Aetherworks Marvel_ itself, were eventually banned. _Copy Cat_ remains one of the most notorious Standard decks ever, not only for its accidental creation but also for the domino effect it had on a format riddled with bans and controversy.

## Startegy

The deck focuses on creating a powerful combo by using Saheeli Rai and Felidar Guardian to copy the Guardian and create infinite cat tokens, allowing for a game-winning board state. The deck also includes cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Rogue Refiner to provide additional value and card advantage. The goal is to quickly assemble the combo pieces while controlling the board with removal spells and utility creatures, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a powerful and strategic synergy between the cards in the deck.

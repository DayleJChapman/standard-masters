## History

During the _Khans of Tarkir_ and _Battle for Zendikar_ Standard format (2015–2016), _Jeskai Black_ emerged as one of the most dominant and ambitious midrange decks in the game’s history. On paper, its mana requirements were absurd—wanting double blue for _Dig Through Time_, double red for _Soulfire Grand Master_ loops, white for _Mantis Rider_, and black for _Crackling Doom_. In most formats, such a greedy manabase would be impossible, but thanks to the perfect combination of _Khans of Tarkir_’s fetchlands and Battle lands like _Smoldering Marsh_, _Jeskai Black_ could cast nearly anything on curve with shocking consistency. This allowed the deck to combine the best elements of multiple strategies: tempo-oriented aggression with _Mantis Rider_, card advantage from _Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy_, reach via _Soulfire Grand Master_ and burn spells, and pinpoint removal with _Crackling Doom_.

The deck’s incredible flexibility made it one of the most adaptable and resilient decks in Standard. It could shift between a proactive midrange plan and a more controlling stance depending on the matchup, leveraging _Dig Through Time_ to find the perfect answers. The sheer strength of its mana base not only enabled _Jeskai Black_ but also paved the way for other four- and even five-color good-stuff decks in the format. However, as the fetchlands rotated and _Dig Through Time_ was banned, _Jeskai Black_ lost its unfair consistency and eventually faded from Standard. Still, its legacy remains as one of the most daring and successful multi-color decks ever, proving just how powerful an optimized manabase can be.

## Startegy

The core strategy of _Jeskai Black_ revolves around threading the needle between aggression and control, leveraging efficient threats like _Mantis Rider_ and _Tasigur, the Golden Fang_ while using pinpoint removal such as _Crackling Doom_ and _Kolaghan’s Command_ to dismantle the opponent’s board. However, the deck’s true power lies in its razor-thin mana sequencing—pilots must carefully plan every fetchland activation and land drop to ensure they can reliably cast _Mantis Rider_ or _Crackling Doom_ on turn three. A single misstep in mana development could mean the difference between seizing control or falling behind. _Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy_ and _Dig Through Time_ provide the card selection and recursion needed to keep the pressure on, ensuring that the deck never runs out of gas. By seamlessly blending aggression with disruption and demanding precise decision-making, _Jeskai Black_ rewards tight play and punishes opponents who can’t keep up with its relentless tempo and versatility.

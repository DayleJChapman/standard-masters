## History

Red Deck Wins (RDW) has long been a staple of Magic, but the Zendikar–Scars of Mirrodin Standard season (2010–2011) saw one of the most brutally efficient iterations of the archetype. Fueled by the hyper-aggressive Goblin Guide, the deck could start applying pressure from turn one, forcing opponents onto the back foot immediately. Backed by Lightning Bolt, Searing Blaze, and Staggershock, the deck never ran out of burn, ensuring that any blockers were removed while also keeping the opponent’s life total under constant assault.

What made this RDW version especially deadly was its ability to maintain pressure beyond the early turns. Chandra’s Phoenix provided a recurring source of evasive damage that synergized perfectly with the deck’s burn suite, while Hero of Oxid Ridge was a devastating curve-topper that not only dealt four damage the turn it hit but also shut down small blockers. Some versions also ran Kargan Dragonlord, which, while slower, gave RDW a scaling threat that could single-handedly win games if left unchecked. This version of Red Deck Wins was fast, resilient, and capable of burning out opponents with terrifying consistency, making it one of the premier aggressive decks of its era.

## Startegy

This RDW build is pure, relentless aggression. The game plan is simple but brutally effective: deploy early threats like Goblin Guide and Chandra’s Phoenix, force damage through with Hero of Oxid Ridge, and finish the opponent off with a flurry of burn spells before they can stabilize. Every card is designed for maximum efficiency—Lightning Bolt is the best rate burn spell ever printed, Searing Blaze punishes opponents for playing creatures, and Staggershock provides a unique source of damage that keeps the pressure up even on the opponent’s turn.

What separates this RDW from others in Magic’s history is its ability to grind through disruption. Chandra’s Phoenix demands repeated exile-based removal, while Kargan Dragonlord offers a rare mana sink that lets RDW pivot into a more midrange-style threat. The deck’s creatures force early damage, and its burn spells ensure the opponent never gets the chance to recover. With a blistering fast clock and just enough resilience to punch through disruption, Zendikar–Scars of Mirrodin RDW was the definition of a well-tuned aggressive deck—quick, consistent, and utterly unforgiving.

## History

During the Zendikar Rising Standard format (2020), Omnath Ramp quickly established itself as one of the most dominant decks the game had ever seen—so much so that it led to multiple bans in rapid succession. At the core of the deck was Omnath, Locus of Creation, a four-color powerhouse that generated absurd amounts of value with its landfall triggers, gaining life, generating mana, and dealing direct damage. Combined with the format’s powerful ramp spells like Lotus Cobra and Escape to the Wilds, Omnath Ramp could rapidly accelerate into game-ending plays while never running out of resources. The deck also utilized Lucky Clover to double up on adventure spells, allowing cards like Fae of Wishes to fetch the perfect answers from the sideboard while Beanstalk Giant and Bonecrusher Giant provided additional threats.

The sheer efficiency and inevitability of Omnath Ramp made it virtually unbeatable, dominating Standard so thoroughly that Omnath, Locus of Creation, Lucky Clover, and Escape to the Wilds were all banned within weeks of release. The deck’s ability to ramp into overwhelming threats while simultaneously controlling the game was simply too much for the format to handle. Even in Historic and Pioneer, versions of Omnath Ramp continued to see play, proving just how broken the deck was when left unchecked. Few decks in Magic’s history have warped a format as quickly and completely as Omnath Ramp, cementing its place as one of the most infamous ramp strategies of all time.

## Startegy

This deck thrives on raw, unrelenting resource generation, leveraging explosive ramp and adventure synergies to bury opponents in value. Lotus Cobra turns every land drop into a burst of mana acceleration, allowing for absurdly fast starts, while Edgewall Innkeeper and Lucky Clover generate a steady stream of card advantage, ensuring the deck never runs out of gas. At the heart of the strategy is Omnath, Locus of Creation, whose landfall triggers single-handedly swing games—gaining life to stabilize, ramping mana to accelerate, and dealing direct damage to close things out. Fae of Wishes serves as a toolbox, fetching the perfect answers from the sideboard, while Beanstalk Giant and Bonecrusher Giant provide flexible threats that keep the board in check. Supported by a perfectly tuned mana base, Omnath Ramp doesn’t just play the long game—it dictates every turn, flooding the board with value until victory is inevitable.

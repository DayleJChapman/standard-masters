## History

During the _Time Spiral_ and _Ravnica_ Standard format (2006–2007), _Dragonstorm_ became one of the most explosive combo decks ever seen in competitive Magic. Built around the namesake sorcery _Dragonstorm_, the deck leveraged cost-reducing spells like _Rite of Flame_, _Seething Song_, and _Lotus Bloom_ to generate enough mana to cast a massive, storm-fueled _Dragonstorm_, often putting multiple _Bogardan Hellkites_ into play and dealing lethal damage instantly. The deck also utilized _Gigadrowse_ to stall opponents and ensure an uninterrupted combo turn. Unlike many combo decks of its time, _Dragonstorm_ had an almost unfair level of consistency, leading to its dominance throughout the format.

One of the most legendary moments in Dragonstorm's history came during the semifinals of the 2007 World Championship between Gabriel Nassif and Patrick Chapin, in a high-stakes Dragonstorm mirror match. In a tense Game 4, Nassif had assembled his combo, but Chapin had one last hope: _Ignite Memories_. With 5 copies of the spell on the stack, Nassif would on the spot if any of them hit his own Ignite Memories, one of only 3 cards in his hand. Instead, Nassif miraculously dodged lethal as Chapin’s _Ignite Memories_ copies mostly hit low-cost spells like _Rite of Flame_, keeping Nassif alive. The dramatic moment, which saw Nassif’s fate hanging on random reveals, became one of the most unforgettable displays of luck and suspense in Magic history. Chapin went on to win the match and advance to the finals, securing _Dragonstorm_'s place as one of the most feared combo decks to ever define a Standard format.

## Startegy

The key idea behind this deck is to generate a large amount of red mana quickly, through cards like Rite of Flame and Lotus Bloom, in order to cast the powerful spells Dragonstorm and Bogardan Hellkite. Both of these cards have a combo-like effect, as Dragonstorm allows the player to search for multiple copies of any creature, while Bogardan Hellkite deals damage to all opponents. The deck also includes various burn spells, like Tarfire and Incinerate, to remove threats and protect the combo. Overall, the main focus of this deck is to assemble the necessary cards to unleash devastating and game-winning combos.
